# Installation Guide

1. Download the whole folder as a ZIP file.

2. Unzip the ZIP file to extract the files and subfolders.

3. Move (or copy) the folder Q3 to either

   $UserBaseDirectory/Applications/ (recommended)

   or

   $BaseDirectory/Applications/

   Here $UserBaseDirectory is the Mathematica(R) symbol, whose value you can check on your Mathematica.

## NOTE

After installing the application, the first time you search a keyword in Wolfram Language Documentation Center (help window) Mathematica builds the search index of the new documentation files. It can take a few seconds to minutes depending on your computer. It happens only once (everytime you update the application) though.
