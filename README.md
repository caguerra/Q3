# Q3

Q3 is a Wolfram Mathematica application to help study quantum information processing, quantum many-body systems, and quantum spin systems. It provides various tools and utilities for symbolic and numerical calculations in these areas of quantum physics.


## Requirements

Q3 requires *Mathematica v12.2 or later*.


## Installation

Since v1.5.1, Q3 provides a *fully automatic installation and update*. Please take a look at the [Installation Guide](./INSTALL.md) (i.e., `INSTALL.md`) for the instructions.


## Quick Start

Once Q3 is installed, put `Q3` or `Q3/guide/Q3` in the search field of the Wolfram Language Documentation Center (Mathematica help window) to get detailed technical information about the application. It will give you users' guides and tutorials.

For more advanced applications, take a look at the [QuantumWorkbook](https://github.com/quantum-mob/QuantumWorkbook) repository, providing a compilation of the Mathematica(R) Notebook files that have been used to generate the demonstrations in ["A Quantum Computation Workbook" (Springer, March 2022)](https://link.springer.com/book/9783030912130).

## For Beginners of Mathematica

If this is your first time to use Mathematica, this guide written by Stephen Wolfram himself might be a good starting point: [An Elementary Introduction to the Wolfram Language (2nd edition)](https://www.wolfram.com/language/elementary-introduction/2nd-ed/).
