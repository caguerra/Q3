# Q3

Q3 is a Mathematica(R) application written in the Wolfram Language. Q3 is to help study quantum information processing, quantum many-body systems, and quantum spin systems. It provides various tools and utilities for symbolic and numerical calculations in these areas of quantum physics.


## Requirements

Q3 requires *Mathematica v12.2 or later*.


## Installation

Q3 provides a *fully automatic installation and update*. Please take a look at the [Installation Guide](./INSTALL.md) for the instructions.


## Quick Start

Once Q3 is installed, put `Q3` or `Q3/guide/Q3` in the search field of the Wolfram Language Documentation Center (Mathematica Help window) to get users' guides and tutorials on Q3; see the following screenshots.

## Quantum Computation and Information with Q3

For more advanced uses of Q3, take a look at textbook ["A Quantum Computation Workbook" (Springer, March 2022)](https://link.springer.com/book/9783030912130).
A compilation of the Mathematica(R) Notebook files that have been used to generate the demonstrations in this textbook is available from
the [QuantumWorkbook repository](https://github.com/quantum-mob/QuantumWorkbook).

## For Beginners of Mathematica

If this is your first time to use Mathematica, this guide written by Stephen Wolfram himself might be a good starting point: [An Elementary Introduction to the Wolfram Language (2nd edition)](https://www.wolfram.com/language/elementary-introduction/2nd-ed/).
