Q3 is a Mathematica application to help study quantum information processing, quantum many-body systems, and quantum spin systems. It provides various tools and utilities for symbolic and numerical calculations in these areas of quantum physics.

Q3 consists of several packages at different levels. Quisso, Fock, and Wigner are the three main packages, and are devoted to the simulation of quantum information processing, quantum many-body systems, and quantum spin systems, respectively. They are based two lower-level packages, Pauli and Cauchy. Pauli itself provides useful tools to handle Pauli operators directly, but it also defines programming structures and objects for the aforementioned three and other higher-level packages. Cauchy, at the lowest level, defines the whole programming structure of the whole application. But it can be used independently to facilitate complex analysis.

The application has been developed mainly for the educational purposes.
