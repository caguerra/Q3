# Q3 Application

Q3 is a Mathematica application to help study quantum information processing, quantum many-body systems, and quantum spin systems. It provides various tools and utilities for symbolic and numerical calculations in these areas of quantum physics.

Q3 consists of several packages at different levels. Quisso, Fock, and Wigner are the three main packages, and they are devoted to the simulation of quantum information processing, quantum many-body systems, and quantum spin systems, respectively. They are based on two other lower-level packages, Pauli and Cauchy. Pauli itself provides useful tools to handle Pauli operators directly, but it also defines programming structures and objects for the aforementioned three and other higher-level packages. Cauchy, at the lowest level, defines the programming structure of the whole application. But it can also be used individually to facilitate complex analysis.

# Installation

1. Download the whole folder as a ZIP file.

2. Unzip the ZIP file to extract the files and subfolders.

3. Move (or copy) the folder Q3 to either

   $UserBaseDirectory/Applications/ (recommended)

   or

   $BaseDirectory/Applications/

   Here $UserBaseDirectory is the Mathematica(R) symbol, whose value you can check on your Mathematica.

# Usage

Once the application is installed, put

     "Q3" or "Q3/guide/Q3"

in the search field of the Wolfram Language Documentation Center (Mathematica help window) to get more information about the application.

## NOTE

After installing the application, the first time you search a keyword in Wolfram Language Documentation Center (help window) Mathematica builds the search index of the new documentation files. It can take a few seconds to minutes depending on your computer. It happens only once (everytime you update the application) though.
